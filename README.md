Battleship Game with GUI:
This project is an interactive implementation of the classic game Battleship, built using Python and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

Multiplayer Support:
The game offers a two-player mode, allowing friends or family to compete locally on the same computer. Players can take turns attempting to sink each other's hidden fleet of ships.

Player Names and Scores:
Players can enter their names at the beginning of the game, and their names are displayed on the GUI. The game keeps track of each player's score (the number of wins) as they play multiple rounds.

Ship Animations:
Upon successfully hitting and sinking an opponent's ship, the game provides a simple visual animation effect. The ship cells briefly change color before being marked as "sunk," enhancing the gameplay experience.

Random Ship Placement:
At the start of each game, ships are randomly placed on the grid for both players, ensuring a unique challenge in each round.

Game Messages:
A message label in the GUI provides real-time updates about whose turn it is and game outcomes, such as announcing the winner when all of one player's ships are sunk.

Scalable Design:
The code is designed to be easily extendable and customizable, making it a great starting point for further enhancements and modifications.

User-Friendly Interface:
The graphical interface simplifies the gameplay experience, allowing players to click on grid cells to take their shots and view their progress.

Simple Animation Effect:
While tkinter has limitations in terms of animations, the sinking ship effect provides a visually appealing touch to the game.
